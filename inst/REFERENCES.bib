    abstract = {Traditional econometric models assume a constant one-period forecast variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

Here, we propose a novel approach for measuring dependence dynamics. We include a hidden Markov chain (MC) in the equation describing dependence dynamics, allowing the unobserved time-varying dependence parameter to vary according to both a restricted ARMA process and an unobserved two-state MC. Estimation is carried out via the inference for the margins in conjunction with filtering/smoothing algorithms. We use block bootstrapping to estimate the covariance matrix of our estimators. Monte Carlo simulations compare the performance of regime switching and no switching models, supporting the regime-switching specification. Finally the proposed approach is applied to empirical data, through the study of the S&P500 (USA), FTSE100 (UK) and BOVESPA (Brazil) stock market indexes.}

We develop a new statistic for measuring, comparing, and testing asymmetries in conditional correlations. Conditional on the downside, correlations in the data differ from the conditional correlations implied by a normal distribution by 11.6. We find that conditional asymmetric correlations are fundamentally different from other measures of asymmetries, such as skewness and co-skewness. We find that small stocks, value stocks, and past loser stocks have more asymmetric movements. Controlling for size, we find that stocks with lower betas exhibit greater correlation asymmetries, and we find no relationship between leverage and correlation asymmetries. Correlation asymmetries in the data reject the null hypothesis of multivariate normal distributions at daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies. However, several empirical models with greater flexibility, particularly regime-switching models, perform better at capturing correlation asymmetries.}

This extends previous work for modeling dependence between innovations of stochastic volatility models. We consider time-dependent and time-independent copula models and we study the asymptotic behavior of some empirical processes constructed from pseudo-observations, as well as the behavior of maximum pseudo-likelihood estimators of the associated copula parameters. The results show that even if the univariate dynamic models depend on unknown parameters, the limiting behavior of many processes of interest does not depend on the estimation errors. One can perform tests for change points on the full distribution, the margins or the copula, as if the parameters of the dynamic models were known. This is also true for some parametric models of time-dependent copulas. This interesting property makes it possible to construct consistent tests of specification for the dependence models, without having to consider the dynamic time series models. Monte Carlo simulations are used to demonstrate the power of the proposed goodness-of-fit test in finite samples. An application to financial data is given.}

We apply the model to returns from the G5 and Latin American regions, and document three main findings.

Second, the choice of copula is important for risk management, since it modifies the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of international portfolios and produces a better out-of-sample performance.

We extend the volatility spillovers investigation by estimating the optimal weights for a minimum risk portfolio and computing the hedge ratio, in an attempt to evaluate optimal portfolio’ allocations and the hedging strategies’ effectiveness. Our findings provide crucial information to agents with respect to the sectors and industries of the stock market in which they need to invest during high volatility regimes in an effort to minimise risk and maximise returns. The protecting capabilities of U.S. stock sectors and industries against oil price volatility seem to be sensitive to a myriad of factors, including the various types of news (oil price changes due to normal or abnormal innovations), and the different volatility regimes (low, normal or high). Overall, this research implication can be relevant for portfolio managers and individual investors who are willing to invest in U.S. stocks.}

The residuals from fractionally integrated models are then used in bivariate time invariant and time varying copulas to investigate dependence structure. Among all Islamic indices, DJIUK, DJIJP and DJICA exhibit time varying dependence with Bitcoin. In addition, we apply VaR, CoVaR and ΔCoVaR as risk measure to examine spillover between Bitcoin and Islamic equity markets. VaR of Bitcoin exceeds from VaR of Islamic indices and CoVaR of both Islamic and Bitcoin exceeds their respective VaR, suggesting presence of risk spillover between each other. Our results also report asymmetry between downside and upside ΔCoVaR suggesting implications for investors with different risk preferences. Finally, the diversification benefits indicate that Islamic equity market serves as an effective hedge in a portfolio along with Bitcoin.}
